# Technical Test
This project involves the implementation of a dog classifier using Laravel, VueJS 3 with Composition API, and Quasar technologies. The main objective is to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to upload a photo of a dog along with detailed information such as breed name, size, and hair color.

## Usage
The application starts on a simple page with a central logo. It has a navbar containing a button on its left to navigate to the Home, and two buttons on the right to Add dogs and view a list of them.
Inside Add, there is a simple form with 4 fields to complete to add the dog's data (Breed Name, Hair Color, Size, and Photo). By completing the data and clicking Save, the new dog is registered in the database.
In the List section, you can see a list of the saved dogs with their characteristics and photos. Additionally, each item in the list has two buttons giving the option to delete and/or edit the respective dog.
Lastly, the Europe Language Jobs section was added to the menu, which is a layout of the page https://www.europelanguagejobs.com/companies
